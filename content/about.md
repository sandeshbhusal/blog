# About Sandesh Bhusal

**Sandesh Bhusal** is an undergrad student currently studying at IOE Pulchowk Campus. He likes to code in his spare time, and is aligned towards user experience design. Internal workings of machines give him goosebumps (quote. Sandesh Bhusal, circa 2018) and algorithms make him whistle. Give him a good algorithm for anything any day of the week, and he will take two weeks to understand it. He is kinda slow but a swell guy.
