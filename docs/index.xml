      <description>Implementation of Tries in C++ From Wikipedia:
In computer science, a Trie is a type of search tree used to represent the retrieval of data (thus the name Trie). It&amp;rsquo;s an ordered data structure that is based on the prefix of a string.
Thus, basically, a trie is a search tree that contains the information about a particular string. However, a trie can contain information also about the prefix and suffix informations on the string.</description>

      <description>About Sandesh Bhusal Sandesh Bhusal is an undergrad student currently studying at IOE Pulchowk Campus. He likes to code in his spare time, and is aligned towards user experience design. Internal workings of machines give him goosebumps (quote. Sandesh Bhusal, circa 2018) and algorithms make him whistle. Give him a good algorithm for anything any day of the week, and he will take two weeks to understand it. He is kinda slow but a swell guy.</description>
